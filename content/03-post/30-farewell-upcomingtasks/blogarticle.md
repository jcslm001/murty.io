UpcomingTasks is an [open-source](https://github.com/brendanmurty/upcomingtasks) responsive [Basecamp 2](https://basecamp.com/2) client that I created back in [September 2012](http://b.murty.io/tag?name=upcomingtasks). It has a small, loyal base of about 1,000 users over the years.

With the recent release of [Basecamp 3](https://basecamp.com/) with a [new API](https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api), I've hesitated in developing updates to UpcomingTasks to support the newest version of Basecamp. This is mainly due to the limited amount of free time I have amongst my full-time job and spending time with friends and family.

I've thought long and hard about keeping this product going indefinitely, but as I pay a monthly fee to host the website and it generates no income, it's hard for me to let it continue in this way. Instead of letting UpcomingTasks become outdated and abandoned, I've decided to **retire the product on the 15th of November, 2016**.

#### What happens to your data?

All of your project, task and user data is stored in your Basecamp 2 account and not on the UpcomingTasks server, so there will be no loss of data.

#### What happens on the 15th of November, 2016?

The website, [upcomingtasks.com](http://upcomingtasks.com/), will redirect to this blog post.

All related UpcomingTasks services and accounts will be shut down.

All users will no longer be able to access UpcomingTasks.

All users will still be able to access and modify their Basecamp data at [basecamp.com/2](https://basecamp.com/2)

#### Who should you contact if you have any questions?

If you have any questions about this, please feel free to email me directly at [b@murty.io](mailto:b@murty.io)
