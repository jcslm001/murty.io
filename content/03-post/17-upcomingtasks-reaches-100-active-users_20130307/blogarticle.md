I’m very proud of my humble little web app, [UpcomingTasks](http://upcomingtasks.com/), as it’s just reached 100 active users!

Born out of my own frustrations with the lack of a suitable Basecamp client for [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/), UpcomingTasks is and always will earn it’s place high on [my homescreen](/assets/images/homescreen.png), no matter what device I’m currently using.

Hope you enjoy using it as much as I do! Haven’t given it a go yet? All you need is a [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com/) account.

*mmm stats*

I’ll continue to refine features and fix bugs as I come across them, but if you’ve got any ideas, or notice something that isn’t quite right, feel free to send me an email at <hello@upcomingtasks.com>
