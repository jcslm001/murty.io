# Visitor redirection

*Posted 20121105*

Redirecting a user consistently can be a challenging in a complex website, as you canâ€™t be sure which method (JavaScript or the [HTTP location header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_location)) is most suitable. This can be handled with a rather simple PHP function:

	<?php
	function redirect($url){
		if(headers_sent()){
			print '<script>window.location="'.$url.'"</script>';
		}else{
			header('Location: '.$url);
		}
		exit();
	}
	?>
