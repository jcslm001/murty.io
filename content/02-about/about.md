I'm a Web Developer with over five years of commercial experience in many areas of website development, training and management. I'm proficient with various front-end and back-end platforms and programming languages. I strive to learn improved methods and techniques to solve complex problems for clients.

I created an [open-source](https://github.com/brendanmurty/upcomingtasks) responsive [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) client called [UpcomingTasks](https://upcomingtasks.com) to easily manage tasks on smaller devices. As of September 2015, the system has around 1000 active users.

I share my thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendanmurty), post photos to [Instagram](https://instagram.com/brendan.murty), track music statistics on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/brendanmurty) and manage my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/brendanmurty).

I enjoy spending time with [family](http://islamurty.com/) and friends, [playing games](http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendanmurty) and reviewing [schnitzels](http://schnitmydadsays.com/).
