I'm an experienced full-stack Web Developer with commercial experience in many areas of website development, training and management.

I'm currently working for [Sentral Education](https://www.sentral.com.au/) where I assist with project management and development of new features for our software products using various front-end and back-end frameworks and languages.

In September 2012, I created an [open-source](https://github.com/brendanmurty/upcomingtasks) responsive [Basecamp 2](https://basecamp.com/2) client called [UpcomingTasks](http://upcomingtasks.com/) to easily manage tasks on smaller devices. The service still has around 1000 active users.

I share my thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendanmurty), post photos to [Instagram](https://instagram.com/brendan.murty) and manage my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/brendanmurty).

I enjoy spending time with [family](http://islamurty.com/) and friends, reviewing [schnitzels](http://schnitmydadsays.com/), playing [Diablo 3](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/murty-1877/career), [Starcraft 2](http://sea.battle.net/sc2/en/profile/148220/1/murty/) and other games on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendanmurty).
